The main challenges encountered the project implementation:

* All components and supplies of the solar system are not available in the local market. This requires that the contractors to request manufacturing of these materials and equipment including inverters, batteries, PV cellsâ€¦etc. at the country of origin (usually European) based on the approved specifications in the tenders documents in order to guarantee genuine parts and longer durability of the solar system

* The manufacturing or production process usually lasts between 2-3 months including the necessary testing and inspection at the factory in the country of origin.

* As the project implementation requires materials coordination, this requires prior approval from the Israeli side on the project itself and the materials before giving the purchase order is given to production company. Such approval usually takes long time until it is obtained. In this project, UNDP managed to get the approval, however, when including a third hospital, UNDP had to request another approval on the additional materials.

* The material entry into Gaza faces other difficulties once imported into the Israeli port (Ashdod) including getting the security scanning and then customs clearance due to huge amounts of materials there.

* Once materials are cleared at Ashdod Port, the materials require a Gate-Pass permit from CLA to move materials from the port into Gaza crossing.
