Al Aqsa Hospital
================

The contactor finished installation, and the system is operational (50kW) and working well. The utility grid availability of only 3-4 hours per day was not enough to charge the batteries at night, so we made additional modifications to the system and connected it with a diesel generator to cover the gap. The system is fully operational and still working well to cover the targeted areas in the hospital.


Indonesian Hospital
====================

The contactor finished installation, and the system is operational (30kW) and working well. In this hospital, the utility grid was made available at all times only for this hospital, but we still made additional modifications to the system to connect it with a diesel generator to ensure stability. The system is fully operational and working well to cover the targeted areas in the hospital.
