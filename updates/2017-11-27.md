Al Aqsa Hospital and Indonesian Hospital
========================================

Installation of the solar system has already been completed and the systems in both hospitals are functioning very well.


Beit Hanoun Hospital
====================

The solar system is installed except the batteries. The system currently operates on-grid during the daytime. The batteries are expected to enter by the end of the year. They have already been imported and stored in Israel and were brought to the crossing two times – the lastest was last Monday – without getting Israeli authorities' permission to enter Gaza. UNDP is trying its best to make the necessary coordination for their entry into Gaza.
